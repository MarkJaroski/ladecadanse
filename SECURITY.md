Thank you for your interest in keeping La d√©cadanse safe

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, the most direct way is to use the [GitHub security advisory tool](https://github.com/agilare/ladecadanse/security/advisories) 

Otherwise, especially if you are a **security researcher** you can contribute to the [Open bug bounty program of ladecadanse](https://www.openbugbounty.org/bugbounty/agilare/) (in compliance with its guidelines)

Please follow the recommendations described on these 2 tools.

I'll try to answer as soon as possible
